Using a unique data set of all loan applications by small firms to a large bank, we show that borrower proximity facilitates the collection of soft information, leading to a trade-off in the availability and pricing of credit, which is more readily accessible to nearby firms albeit at higher interest rates ceteris paribus. Analyzing loan rates and firms’ decision to switch lenders provides further evidence for banks’ strategic use of private information. However, distance erodes our lender’s ability to collect proprietary intelligence and to carve out local captive markets, suggesting that the requisite soft information is primarily local.},

These results suggest that hedge funds manage their returns upward in an opportunistic fashion in order to earn higher fees. Finally, we find strong evidence that funds inflate December returns by underreporting returns earlier in the year but only weak evidence that funds borrow from January returns in the following year.},

  abstract  = {Technological advances in telecommunications, securities exchanges, and algorithmic trading have facilitated a host of new investment products that resemble theme-based passive indexes, but depart from traditional market-cap-weighted portfolios. In this article, the author proposes broadening the definition of an index using a functional perspective. Any portfolio strategy that satisfies three properties should be considered an index: (1) it is completely transparent, (2) it is investable, and (3) it is systematic (i.e., it is entirely rules-based and involves no judgment or unique investment skill). Portfolios satisfying these properties that are not market-cap-weighted are given a new name: dynamic indices. This functional definition widens the universe of possibilities and, most importantly, decouples risk management from alpha generation. Passive strategies can and should be actively risk managed, and the author provides a simple example of how this can be achieved. Dynamic indices also create new challenges; the most significant of these is backtest bias, and the author concludes with a proposal for managing this risk.},

We prove that, under certain conditions, LSI does succeed in capturing the underlying semantics of the corpus and achieves improved retrieval performance. We propose the technique of random projection as a way of speeding up LSI. We complement our theorems with encouraging experimental results. We also argue that our results may be viewed in a more general framework, as a theoretical basis for the use of spectral methods in a wider class of applications such as collaborative filtering."

  abstract = {This paper examines whether analysts resident in a country make more precise earnings forecasts for firms in that country than non-resident analysts. Using a sample of 32 countries, we find an economically and statistically significant local analyst advantage even after controlling for firm and analyst characteristics. The local advantage is high in countries where earnings are smoothed more, less information is disclosed by firms, and firm idiosyncratic information explains a smaller fraction of stock returns. It is negatively related to whether a firm has foreign assets and to market participation by foreign investors and by institutions, and positively related to holdings by insiders. The extent to which U.S. investors underweight a country's stocks is positively related to that country's local analyst advantage.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Recent research finds that the stocks that mutual fund managers buy outperform the stocks that they sell (e.g., Chen, Jegadeesh, and Wermers (2000)). We study the nature of this stock-picking ability. We construct measures of trading skill based on how the stocks held and traded by fund managers perform at subsequent corporate earnings announcements. This approach increases the power to detect skilled trading and sheds light on its source. We find that the average fund’s recent buys significantly outperform its recent sells around the next earnings announcement, and that this accounts for a disproportionate fraction of the total abnormal returns to fund trades estimated in prior work. We find that mutual fund trades also forecast earnings surprises. We conclude that mutual fund managers are able to trade profitably in part because they are able to forecast earnings-related fundamentals.},

The vision of one man, the American economist Walter Isard, regional science represented the first systematic attempt to further joint work between geographers and economists. Within this context, the tasks of the paper are twofold. The first is to provide an interpretative history of the rise of regional science, and to a much lesser extent its decline. The interpretative framework derives from science studies, and in particular the work of Bruno Latour. The history is based on archival material and interviews. The second is to speculate briefly on the implications of both the interpretive framework used in the paper, and the history of regional science told, for the new economic geography that similarly attempts to convene discussions between economists and geographers.},

Suggesting that the globalization of the world economy benefits the wealthy in a variety of ways, we accordingly argue that much is to be gained by exposing the contemporary geographies of the super-rich, beginning by highlighting their transnational reach and global influence.},

The U.S. has exceptionally many actively-traded firms with widely-diffused stockholding because public policy has favored stock market liquidity over active investing.

In collaboration with the founding and subsequent economics’ editors of the Journal, Wrigley’s stewardship of the Journal has taken a start-up venture into the very heart of four disciplines. This introduction to the special issue honouring his achievements considers the place of the Journal in the field of economic geography, its impact and how the articles of this special issue relate to Wrigley’s own research programme.},

  abstract = {In this study, we explore the dynamics of the relation between institutional trading and stock returns. We find that stock returns Granger-cause institutional trading (especially purchases) on a quarterly basis. The robust and significant causality from equity returns to institutional trading can be largely explained by the time-series variation of market returns, that is, institutions buy more popular stocks after market rises. Stock returns appear to be negatively related to lagged institutional trading. A further analysis of the behavior of trading and the returns of the traded stocks reveals evidence that stocks with heavy institutional buying (selling) experience positive (negative) excess returns over the previous 12 months.},

Understanding the origins and persistence of the unique banking regulations that have defined U.S. banking for more than a century lends an important perspective to the economic and political causes and consequences of the current process of deregulation. History helps to define the political constituencies for and against deregulation, the political process through which bank regulations are determined, and the way deregulation likely will affect future bank performance and stability."--BOOK JACKET.},

  Abstract                 = {Applying a geographic lens to mutual fund performance, this study finds that fund managers earn substantial abnormal returns in nearby investments. These returns are particularly strong among funds that are small and old, focus on few holdings, and operate out of remote areas. Furthermore, we find that while the average fund exhibits only a modest bias toward local stocks, certain funds strongly bias their holdings locally and exhibit even greater local performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the extent to which a firm is held by nearby investors is positively related to its future expected return. Our results suggest that investors trade local securities at an informational advantage and point toward a link between such trading and asset prices.},

  abstract = {‘Digital’ telecommunication flows and ‘physical’ corporeal flows provide researchers with comprehensive indicators of the economic interactions between cities. However, previous research drawing on telecommunication-based measures of inter-urban connectivity has been hampered by inadequate conceptualizations and data. This paper draws on this observation to devise a new approach for measuring inter-urban connectivity based on a city’s insertion in Internet backbone networks. The straightforward example of air transport flows is thereby used to outline this approach. To investigate telecommunication and air passenger flows, use is made of European statistics on Internet eXchange Points and the \{MIDT\} airline database respectively. The approach is illustrated through a systematic comparison of the position of European cities in both types of networks. It is found that European cities assume largely similar hierarchical levels in terms of digital and physical information flows, albeit that the digital connectivity of centrally located European cities is often somewhat higher than that of peripheral cities with a similar levels of physical connectivity.},

  abstract = {Abstract We provide insights into earnings quality from a survey of 169 \{CFOs\} of public companies and in-depth interviews of 12 \{CFOs\} and two standard setters. \{CFOs\} believe that (i) above all, high-quality earnings are sustainable and repeatable; specific characteristics include consistent reporting choices, backing by actual cash flows, and absence of one-time items and long-term estimates; (ii) about 50% of earnings quality is driven by non-discretionary factors such as industry and macro-economic conditions; (iii) in any given period, about 20% of firms manage earnings to misrepresent economic performance, and for such firms 10% of \{EPS\} is typically managed; (iv) earnings manipulation is hard to unravel from the outside but peer comparisons and lack of correspondence between earnings and cash flows provide helpful red flags. In addition, \{CFOs\} disagree with current standard setting on a number of issues including the sheer number of promulgated rules, the top-down approach to rule-making, the neglect of the matching principle, and the emphasis on fair value accounting. They indicate that a rules-based culture makes the audit function centralized and mechanical, and hinders the development of audit professionals. A summary impression from our work is that \{CFOs\} view earnings quality as more of a single and unconditional characteristic, in contrast to current research where measures of earnings quality are strongly conditional on the decision setting. This \{CFO\} view is related to their idea of “one number” – a single earnings metric that shapes both their interactions with external stakeholders and internal decision-making.},

Firms with higher ownership by foreign and independent institutions have higher firm valuations, better operating performance, and lower capital expenditures. Our results indicate that foreign and independent institutions, with potentially fewer business ties to firms, are involved in monitoring corporations worldwide.},

All five series show consistent global warming trends ranging from 0.014 to 0.018?K?yr ?1 . When the data are adjusted to remove the estimated impact of known factors on short-term temperature variations (El Ni?o/southern oscillation, volcanic aerosols and solar variability), the global warming signal becomes even more evident as noise is reduced. Lower-troposphere temperature responds more strongly to El Ni?o/southern oscillation and to volcanic forcing than surface temperature data. The adjusted data show warming at very similar rates to the unadjusted data, with smaller probable errors, and the warming rate is steady over the whole time interval. In all adjusted series, the two hottest years are 2009 and 2010.},

The capital allocated to high-leverage strategies may be vulnerable even to small changes in market-access costs, which can lead to discontinuous price drops, de-leveraging, and portfolio-flow reversals.

  Abstract                 = {This paper raises basic questions about the process of economic growth. It questions the assumption, nearly universal since Solow’s seminal contributions of the 1950s, that economic growth is a continuous process that will persist forever. There was virtually no growth before 1750, and thus there is no guarantee that growth will continue indefinitely. Rather, the paper suggests that the rapid progress made over the past 250 years could well turn out to be a unique episode in human history. The paper is only about the United States and views the future from 2007 while pretending that the financial crisis did not happen. Its point of departure is growth in per-capita real GDP in the frontier country since 1300, the U.K. until 1906 and the U.S. afterwards. Growth in this frontier gradually accelerated after 1750, reached a peak in the middle of the 20th century, and has been slowing down since. The paper is about “how much further could the frontier growth rate decline?”

The analysis links periods of slow and rapid growth to the timing of the three industrial revolutions (IR’s), that is, IR #1 (steam, railroads) from 1750 to 1830; IR #2 (electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum) from 1870 to 1900; and IR #3 (computers, the web, mobile phones) from 1960 to present. It provides evidence that IR #2 was more important than the others and was largely responsible for 80 years of relatively rapid productivity growth between 1890 and 1972. Once the spin-off inventions from IR #2 (airplanes, air conditioning, interstate highways) had run their course, productivity growth during 1972-96 was much slower than before. In contrast, IR #3 created only a short-lived growth revival between 1996 and 2004. Many of the original and spin-off inventions of IR #2 could happen only once – urbanization, transportation speed, the freedom of females from the drudgery of carrying tons of water per year, and the role of central heating and air conditioning in achieving a year-round constant temperature.

Even if innovation were to continue into the future at the rate of the two decades before 2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the process of dragging long-term growth to half or less of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between 1860 and 2007. These include demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and the overhang of consumer and government debt. A provocative “exercise in subtraction” suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades.},

Using managerial and bank control theories as a basis for description, the network-based analyses show a hierarchical urban system dominated by a few core urban centers, in particular New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. A review of industrial network theory emphasizes the importance of analyses by interfirm and interplace connections. The strength of interplace connections defines six classes of urban centers. Analyses by industrial class show financial, insurance, and real estate firms (FIRE) are the dominant institutional stockholders. Simple gravity models show weak or no distance-decay effects for firm and place-based stock ownership networks. Public pension plans show considerable leakage of funds from their home regions. Maps and tables describe investment patterns of selected individual cities and firms. A 50-percent random sample of Fortune 500 and the population of large FIRE firms provides the data for analyses.},

With a self-declared value of almost \$13 trillion, it is the largest class of equity investors. Included are all investors who file Securities Exchange Commission {(SEC)} form 13f, meaning they manage at least \$100 million. Analysis is undertaken at both the firm and metropolitan levels. The largest firms and targets of investment are determined. Geographic concentrations of both investors and their major stock holdings occur in a small subset (the top 10 largest metropolitan areas). The rates of returns on investments are shown to differ by metropolitan area of investment and by urban rank in the urban hierarchy. Intra-metropolitan investment provides worse rates of returns, countering suggestions of informational advantages for local investment. The network of interurban investments shows a clear hierarchical structure, with New York City being the dominant investment centre.},

Decomposing returns into three components, we find that hedge funds are better than mutual funds at stock picking by only 1.32% per year on a value-weighted basis, and this result is insignificant on an equal-weighted basis or with price-to-sales benchmarks. Hedge funds exhibit no ability to time sectors or pick better stock styles. Surprisingly, we find only weak evidence of differential ability between hedge funds. Overall, our study raises serious questions about the perceived superior skill of hedge fund managers.},

  abstract = {In the United States, the goal of essential air service (EAS) is to provide a minimum level of air transport service from smaller, often remote communities to the national network. While supporters of \{EAS\} tout the economic benefits of connecting rural and isolated communities, critics cite high costs, low use and antiquated eligibility requirements as factors which compromise the value of the program. In this paper, a comprehensive database of \{US\} airports is combined with network analysis techniques and a geographic information system to evaluate population access (at the census tract level) to \{EAS\} airports for 2006. Results suggest that redundant coverage of \{EAS\} market areas by alternative Federal Aviation Administration designated hub airports can contribute to \{EAS\} airport market leakage and that alternative definitions of \{EAS\} community eligibility have the potential to dramatically increase programmatic efficiency and reduce federal monies spent on \{EAS\} subsidies.},

  abstract = {The global air transportation network is responsible for moving millions of domestic and international passengers each year. Not surprisingly, relationships between airports vary widely, due to a myriad of geographic, economic, political and historical determinants. Further, given the dynamic nature of the many influences acting on the air transportation system, inter-airport relationships and the structure of the global air network as a whole are also constantly changing. The purpose of this paper is to explore such spatio-temporal variations in the structure of the global airport hierarchies. Here, we show how the concept of nodal regions can be applied to measure the extent of these variations. To facilitate this analysis, a database of nearly 900 airline carrier schedules and 4650 worldwide origins and destinations, representing a nearly complete record of commercial air travel over a six-year period, is examined. Given this dataset, nodal regions are derived for all airports represented. In general, results suggest that regions associated with individual airports are often relatively dynamic at the yearly as well as quarterly level. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is utilized as a local case-study to provide a detailed examination of these dynamics.},

I then review how recent work in economic geography has used these approaches to develop understandings of the role of financial circuits in everyday economic life and the implications of this for the international financial system. This research is important because it problematizes popular and policy calls to rebalance the economic activity in favour of the ‘real economy’. I argue that this highlights the need to examine how financial circuits might be produced differently in order to develop a more sustainable financial system and associated economy.},

Such an approach is valuable because it responds to calls for cultural economy research to consider the political and normative dimensions of money and finance more fully.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluids trapped as inclusions within minerals can be billions of years old and preserve a record of the fluid chemistry and environment at the time of mineralization. Aqueous fluids that have had a similar residence time at mineral interfaces and in fractures (fracture fluids) have not been previously identified. Expulsion of fracture fluids from basement systems with low connectivity occurs through deformation and fracturing of the brittle crust. The fractal nature of this process must, at some scale, preserve pockets of interconnected fluid from the earliest crustal history. In one such system, 2.8 kilometres below the surface in a South African gold mine, extant chemoautotrophic microbes have been identified in fluids isolated from the photosphere on timescales of tens of millions of years. Deep fracture fluids with similar chemistry have been found in a mine in the Timmins, Ontario, area of the Canadian Precambrian Shield. Here we show that excesses of {(124)Xe,} {(126)Xe} and {(128)Xe} in the Timmins mine fluids can be linked to xenon isotope changes in the ancient atmosphere and used to calculate a minimum mean residence time for this fluid of about 1.5 billion years. Further evidence of an ancient fluid system is found in {(129)Xe} excesses that, owing to the absence of any identifiable mantle input, are probably sourced in sediments and extracted by fluid migration processes operating during or shortly after mineralization at around 2.64 billion years ago. We also provide closed-system radiogenic noble-gas {((4)He,} {(21)Ne,} {(40)Ar,} {(136)Xe)} residence times. Together, the different noble gases show that ancient pockets of water can survive the crustal fracturing process and remain in the crust for billions of years.},

  abstract            = {During the last 30 years, U.S. metropolitan economies have experienced tremendous restructuring, and the locations of corporate headquarters have increasingly exhibited spatial shifts, both deconcentrating and dispersing. Theoretical explanations have suggested that the United States is entering the third of four stages, in which we are now witnessing the drive to regional maturity with no dominant regional center. Changes in the distribution of metropolitan corporate dominance between 1980 and 1987 are examined and related to two sets of explanatory frameworks, one spatial and the other structural. Changes in metropolitan corporate dominance were strongly related to spatial shifts in headquarters and asset location, especially shifts due to merger and acquisition activity. Changes in dominance were less strongly related to structural factors reflecting the degree of transition to the emerging service-based economy, even though population and location relative to New York were important. Finally, the effect of spatial and structural factors on changes in metropolitan corporate dominance varied, depending on the size of the center.},

We hypothesize that remotely located firms facing free cash flow problems precommit to higher dividends to mitigate agency conflicts. We find that remotely located firms pay higher dividends. As expected, the effect of geography on dividends is most pronounced for firms with severe free cash flow problems. Further, remotely located firms rely more on regular dividends instead of special dividends or share repurchases and decrease dividends less often.},

  Abstract                 = {:Contingency tables are a very common basis for the investigation of effects of different treatments or influences on a disease or the health state of patients. Many journals put a strong emphasis on p-values to support the validity of results. Therefore, even small contingency tables are analysed by techniques like t-test or ANOVA. Both these concepts are based on normality assumptions for the underlying data. For larger data sets, this assumption is not so critical, since the underlying statistics are based on sums of (independent) random variables which can be assumed to follow approximately a normal distribution, at least for a larger number of summands. But for smaller data sets, the normality assumption can often not be justified.Robust methods like the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test do not lead to statistically significant p-values for small samples. Median polish is a robust alternative to analyse contingency tables providing much more insight than just a p-value.Median polish is a technique that provides more information than just a p-value. It explains the contingency table in terms of an overall effect, row and columns effects and residuals. The underlying model for median polish is an additive model which is sometimes too restrictive. In this paper, we propose two related approach to generalise median polish. A power transformation can be applied to the values in the table, so that better results for median polish can be achieved. We propose a graphical method how to find a suitable power transformation. If the original data should be preserved, one can apply other transformations - based on so-called additive generators - that have an inverse transformation. In this way, median polish can be applied to the original data, but based on a non-additive model. The non-linearity of such a model can also be visualised to better understand the joint effects of rows and columns in a contingency table.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the continued increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the annual-mean global temperature has not risen in the twenty-first century, challenging the prevailing view that anthropogenic forcing causes climate warming. Various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming, but their relative importance has not been quantified, hampering observational estimates of climate sensitivity. Here we show that accounting for recent cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific reconciles climate simulations and observations. We present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global temperature change by prescribing, in addition to radiative forcing, the observed history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical Pacific in a climate model. Although the surface temperature prescription is limited to only 8.2\% of the global surface, our model reproduces the annual-mean global temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r = 0.97 for 1970-2012 (which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming). Moreover, our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of the hiatus, including the intensified Walker circulation, the winter cooling in northwestern North America and the prolonged drought in the southern {USA.} Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a {La-Ni\&\#xF1;a-like} decadal cooling. Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase.},

"Michael Lewis's splendid cast of characters includes villains, a few heroes, and a lot of people who look very, very foolish: high government officials, including the watchdogs;; heads of major investment banks (some overlap here with previous category);; perhaps even the face in your mirror. In this trenchant, raucous, irresistible narrative, Lewis writes of the goats and of the few who saw what the emperor was wearing, and gives them, most memorably, what they deserve. He proves yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times."--BOOK JACKET.},

Inclusion of other possible determinants of capital structure, such as availability of internal funds, tax effects and risk, while significant, do not affect the importance of discretionary investment. The evidence supports (1) the existence of a moral bazzard problem which inversely relates risky debt and discretionary investment choice, and (2) a desire by most firms to use sources of internal funds prior to entering the capital market.},

  Abstract                 = {We exploit the restrictions of intertemporal portfolio choice in the presence of nonfinancial income risk to test hedging using the information contained in the actual portfolio of the investor. We use a unique data set of Swedish investors with information broken down at the investor level and into various components of investor wealth, income, and demographic characteristics. Portfolio holdings are identified at the stock level. We show that investors do not hedge but invest in stocks closely related to their nonfinancial income. We explain this with familiarity, that is, the tendency to concentrate holdings in stocks to which the investor is geographically or professionally close or that he has held for a long period. We show that familiarity is not a behavioral bias, but is information driven. Familiarity-based investment allows investors to earn higher returns than they would have otherwise earned if they had hedged.},

  Abstract                 = {As part of community/regional development policy, governments in Canada attempt to create conditions that stimulate the formation of high-technology clusters and, in so doing, often encourage firm–university/college liaisons. Information technology (IT) is an important segment of the high-technology sector, and small- and medium-sized Canadian IT firms are disproportionately attracted to large metropolitan areas (with Toronto, Ottawa–Hull, Vancouver, Calgary, Montréal, Kitchener and Edmonton being the most noteworthy). A nearest neighbour analysis suggests that small- and medium-sized IT firms are clustered within the metropolitan setting, and a nearest neighbour hierarchical spatial clustering technique demonstrates that intra-urban IT agglomerations can be objectively identified. The linkages between small- and medium-sized IT firms and higher education institutions are, on average, not strongly entrenched within Canada's IT culture, although many of these firms still connect with universities or colleges through co-operative programs and other means of employee recruitment and via general networking with faculty members. Thus, governments may be able to support IT cluster formation by encouraging firm–university/college connections that centre on student participation.},

Our findings suggest that the major organizing institutions within the corporate world are the largest New York commercial banks, themselves united by a small number of prominent insurance companies. These institutions lend an order to corporate affairs and maintain a loose unity among firms. Although sources of conflict remain, patterns of director interlocks emphasize the capacity for cohesion supplied by the financial sector and suggest that mechanisms for conflict resolution reside within U. S. business.},

  Abstract                 = {Drawing on comparative institutional theory, this paper examines post-acquisition integration in international acquisitions, which has seldom been examined through this perspective. Based on a longitudinal and comparative study of three blue-chip French acquirers in the UK that shared similar integration intentions but realized those to varying degrees, this paper theorizes this variation in integration outcomes as a dynamic interplay of institutional distance, market structure and power dependencies. Whilst all important, those effects do not equally explain integration outcomes and can only be understood in conjunction with one another. Thus, contrary to a core assumption of institutional theory that institutional distance is consistently a dominant influence on multinational firms’ behaviour, the study shows that its effect is varied. It will only become extremely constraining when the market structure is highly localized, and both dynamics combine to make the acquirer largely dependent on the target firm. The study’s first contribution is to provide a fuller conceptual understanding of post-acquisition integration. Secondly, it introduces the role of market structure into a politico-institutional framework and, thirdly, it demonstrates complex relationships among three effects located at multiple levels. The results have important implications for the debate about environmental determinism vs multinationals’ agency at host-country level.},

Airline traffic data have been proposed as a promising solution, but these data introduce their own complications. In this paper, the Airline Origin and Destination Survey is used to refine this approach, distinguishing first between hub/spoke and origin/destination networks and, secondly, between networks of business-oriented and leisure-oriented travel among 115 US metropolitan areas in 2006. After illustrating the importance of these distinctions with employment data from the American Community Survey, the resulting and more narrowly focused business network is used to test a model of urban economic flows. Results suggest that the volume of business exchanges between US cities is a function of the cities’ own attributes and as well as relational factors including economic similarity.},

The change has been at the expense of the very large global cities and major hubs in favour of a group of next largest cities. It has been detected by comparing the shares of total passenger movement through cities in two separate ways, and by exploring changes in the connectivity between cities over a similar time period. The new pattern reflects the use of new aircraft technology, changes in the location of demand for air travel associated with a broadening in the global linkages between cities, new regulatory arrangements and airline corporate strategies. The implications are that the pressures for airport planning will be felt in a new set of cities, although because the share of passenger traffic through the very large global cities is still high they will remain a major focus for airport planning and management action in the immediate future.},

This paper provides a brief overview of the characteristics of these low-cost carriers as well as their history and geography. It goes on to outline ways in which these carriers compete and manage demand, ranging from price competition to advertising; some of these methods directly reflect their special characteristics. Some empirical evidence is presented which indicates a correlation in fare setting behaviour between competitors and insights are offered on cost recovery. The impact of the start-up of low-cost carriers is also analysed, focusing on their impacts on other low-cost carriers. The case of Ryanair competing with easyJet on London–Venice is examined along with Southwest and Frontier on Denver–Las Vegas.},

We investigate the latter using a matrix regression analysis, that we call ‘Principal Regression Analysis’ (PRA) and for which we provide some analytical (using Random Matrix Theory) and numerical benchmarks. We find that downward index trends increase the average correlation between stocks (as measured by the most negative eigenvalue of the conditional correlation matrix), and makes the market mode more uniform. Upward trends, on the other hand, also increase the average correlation between stocks but rotates the corresponding market mode away from uniformity. There are two time scales associated to these effects, a short one on the order of a month (20 trading days), and a longer time scale on the order of a year. We also find indications of a leverage effect for sectorial correlations as well, which reveals itself in the second and third mode of the PRA.},

  abstract = {After deregulation in the \{US\} in 1978, air carrier networks were increasingly focused around a small number of hubs. These ‘hub-and-spoke’ (HS) networks were the predominant form of network organisation of large carriers as well as smaller regional and commuter carriers. The passenger carrier networks typically consisted of between three and seven hubs, while the air freight carrier networks were typically focused around one or two hubs. A variety of measures of the traffic distribution in carriers’ networks have been presented in the economics and regional science literature. These measures are reviewed and compared for a sample of \{US\} major carriers for the period 1969–99. The \{HS\} network structure requires a concentration of traffic in both space and time. The summary measures presented focus on measuring the spatial concentration at discrete locations in the networks. The emergence of a new wave of low-cost airline entrants has been a significant component in the more recent development of the \{US\} air transport industry. Southwest Airlines began its operations in the early 1970s and has been copied in the \{US\} and Europe in terms of its network organisation, management, service and operating characteristics. The \{US\} ‘low-cost’ operators are examined in the paper in terms of their traffic distribution patterns using the same summary measures used for the full-service operators. It is demonstrated that the low-cost carriers have a lower level of concentration on average than the full-service carriers. The low-cost carriers focus their traffic flows around a limited number of key nodes—these nodes function as points of entry or exit rather than transfer points.},

  abstract = {A new banking power currently under consideration is bank direct equity investment in real estate. A portfolio analysis of the possible effect of this new power is presented using two sets of data on returns to direct real estate investment. While it is estimated that there can be benefits from bank diversification into this area, the results suggest that risk may be increased, rather than reduced, if real estate investment exceeds certain relatively low levels of concentration.},

We generalized the Soviet electrical system as a network of supply nodes, demand nodes, and bounded arcs. The optimal flows and associated costs for the network are determined by the application of the out-of-kilter algorithm. The modeled flows are hypothetical, but numerous policy implications are discussed in our analysis. We identify several transmission obstacles and indicate which proposed extra-high-voltage lines should be built. Additional investment in the expansion of energy-generating capacity in the eastern Soviet Union seems to be unnecessary.},

  Abstract                 = {In creating the Caisse, its architects wanted to go above and beyond the mere ob jective of providing a pension fund for Quebecers. Thus, while the legislature did not spec ify it as such in the act, the Caisse was entrusted with a clearly defined mission by Jean Lesa ge, Quebec's premier at the time: the Caisse should achieve an optimal financial return while contributing to the dynamism of the Quebec economy and preserving the security of capital under management. This was the essence of his speech to the National Assembly. Twenty - seven year s later, this mission is still just as valid. This is what makes our work different, this is w hat makes our work complex, this is what makes our work exciting. On the equity side, with a portfolio of over $11 billion invested in over 250 Ca nadian companies, the Caisse has earned the title of the largest institutional sharehol der in Canada. In fact, our portfolio of Canadian equities represents approximately 4% of the tota l capitalization of Canadian stock markets. The Caisse is the major shareholder of about half the companies on the TSE 35. What do major Canadianbanks such as the Royal Bank, the Toronto Dom inion Bank, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Bank of Montreal as well as co mpanies such as BCE Inc., Laidlaw, Maclean Hunter, Moore Corporation, Thomson Corporatio n, Imperial Oil and John Labatt have in common? They all have a common major shareh older -- the Caisse de depo@t et placement du Queebec, whose stock holdings make it the n umber one or number two shareholder of these companies. In our present - day environment, managers must be on the lookout for every oppo rtunity to maximize their returns. Tactical allocation is another form of active management practiced by the Caisse, which helps it reach its added - value objective. It consists of div erging from target strategic long - term allocations, and overweighting and underweighting various asset classes according to the overall economic situation and the relative evaluation of finan cial markets. Through this practice, the Caisse can identify and take advantage of yield diffe rentials between certain asset classes, using highly liquid instruments -- derivative products su ch as baskets of equities as well as futures and options markets to quickly make large - scale tr ansactions at minimal cost. Over the last three years, the managers responsible for these stra tegies at the Caisse succeeded in achieving an added value of approximately $250 million. A nu mber of models are used, including top - down and bottom - up evaluations as well as a m odel that incorporates the market's momentum. Strategies are generally adjusted only when the majority of the evaluation models produce converging signals.},

It examines first what makes inter- disciplinarity difficult, focusing on the production of disciplinary cultures that define the material practices, social relations and epistemological commitments characteristic of a field of study. The paper then considers why interdisciplinarity seems to be in the ascendant and why and how geography has been used in this project. It cautions against a reductionist or imperialist style of interdisciplinary work and encourages geographers to develop their own approach to a productive engagement with other fields, in part through attending to the interdisciplinarity inherent in our own.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper opens with a statement on the social embeddedness of knowledge. The disciplinary situation and practices of economic geographers are reviewed in the light of this statement. The rise of a new geographical economics is noted, and its main thrust is summarized in terms of a description of the core model as formulated by Krugman. The geographers' reception of the new geographical economics is described, and some key aspects of this reception are assessed. I then subject the core model itself to critical evaluation. Its claims about pecuniary externalities in the context of Chamberlinian competition provide a number of useful insights. However, I argue that the model is deficient overall in the manner in which it tackles the central problem of agglomeration. The discussion then moves on to consideration of the recent interest shown by many economic geographers in issues of culture. After a brief exposition of what this means for economic geography, I offer the verdict that this shift of emphasis has much to recommend it, but that in some of its more extreme versions it is strongly susceptible to the temptations of philosophical idealism and political voluntarism. In the final part of the paper, I attempt to pinpoint some of the major tasks ahead for economic geography in the phase of post-‘late capitalism’. I suggest, in particular, that a new cognitive map of capitalist society as a whole is urgently needed, and I offer some brief remarks about how its basic specifications might be identified.},

  Abstract                 = {"In ECONned, Yves Smith draws a direct connection between fundamentally flawed financial theories and a series of crises that culminated in the global meltdown of 2007 and 2008. This devastating critique shows that the pursuit of unenlightened self interest has produced a financial services industry that is a doomsday machine, systematically predatory, and now hugely powerful thanks to its control of vital financial infrastructure." "This is the first book to put the financial crisis in its proper context, as not merely a subprime mortgage meltdown, but the inevitable culmination of a process building over decades yet endorsed by mainstream economists and enabled by their flawed precepts."--BOOK JACKET.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that the ongoing financial and economic crisis creates an opportunity for economic geography to move to a centre stage of academic debates about the nature of contemporary capitalism. Such a ‘newer’ economic geography needs to start by injecting finance and financialisation into conceptualisations of economies and their uneven geographies and by re-engaging with the issues of value(s), value flows and circuits of value. The paper highlights one particular aspect of circuits of value that takes a form of credit–debt relationship.},

I find, relative to an augmented Fung and Hsieh (2004) factor model, that hedge funds with a physical presence (head or research office) in their investment region outperform other hedge funds by 3.72% per year. The local information advantage is pervasive across all major geographical regions, but is strongest for emerging market funds and funds holding illiquid securities. These results are robust to adjustments for fund fees, serial correlation, backfill bias, and incubation bias. I show also that distant funds, especially those based in the United States and the United Kingdom, are able to raise more capital, charge higher fees, and set longer redemption periods, despite their underperformance relative to nearby funds. It appears that distant funds trade investment performance for better access to capital.},

First, there is strong evidence of a home bias in national investment portfolios despite the potential gains from international diversification. Second, the composition of the portfolio of foreign securities seems to reflect factors other than diversification of risk. Third, the high volume of cross-border capital flows and the high turnover rate on foreign equity investments relative to turnover on domestic equity markets suggests that variable transactions costs are an unlikely explanation for home bias.},

  abstract = {Ordinary least squares linear regression models are frequently used to analyze and model spatial phenomena. These models are useful and easily interpreted, and the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of these models are well studied and understood. Regression models applied to spatial data frequently contain spatially autocorrelated residuals, however, indicating a misspecification error. This problem is limited to spatial data (although similar problems occur with time series data), so it has received less attention than more frequently encountered problems. A method called spatial filtering with eigenvectors has been proposed to account for this problem. We apply this method to ten real-world data sets and a series of simulated data sets to begin to understand the conditions under which the method can be most usefully applied. We find that spatial filtering with eigenvectors reduces spatial misspecification errors, increases the strength of the model fit, frequently increases the normality of model residuals, and can increase the homoscedasticity of model residuals. We provide a sample script showing how to apply the method in the R statistical environment. Spatial filtering with eigenvectors is a powerful geographic method that should be applied to many regression models that use geographic data.},

  Abstract                 = {Many argue that home bias arises because home investors can predict home asset payoffs more accurately than foreigners can. But why does global information access not eliminate this asymmetry? We model investors, endowed with a small home information advantage, who choose what information to learn before they invest. Surprisingly, even when home investors can learn what foreigners know, they choose not to: Investors profit more from knowing information others do not know. Learning amplifies information asymmetry. The model matches patterns of local and industry bias, foreign investments, portfolio outperformance, and asset prices. Finally, we propose new avenues for empirical research.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT  This paper aims to contribute to the debate on the future of stock exchanges and financial centres by focusing on two questions. First, whether, how, why, and which stock exchange activities are prone to concentration in financial centres? Second, are they prone to concentration in national or international financial centres? Through a detail-rich analysis of stock exchange activities, including trading system, as well as relationships with members, issuers, and investors, the paper suggests a framework for the geography of stock exchange activities based on two dimensions—proneness to concentration in a financial centre and proneness to international consolidation. With this framework, predictions are made about the future geography of stock exchange activities led by the argument that while significant geographical reconfigurations are likely to unfold, driven primarily by the development of international networks of stock market institutions, stock exchanges, and financial centres will remain crucially important for each other.},

  abstract = {Using the newly released Census for Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) 1990, this research utilizes GIS tools to explain intraurban variations of commuting in Chicago at the Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) level. While commute times are directly available from the CTPP, commute distances are derived from the shortest time distances through real-world road networks. GIS surface modeling is used to help identify the major employment center (CBD) and other subcenters. The explanations of commute times and distances are attempted by various measures of job accessibility: the jobs-housing balance ratio defined in a floating catchment area, distances from the CBD and subcenters, and a gravity-based index that takes the effects of all jobs into account. These measurements better explain how far people commute than how much time they spend on commuting. The best model explains over 50% of the variation of commuting among 7,835 TAZs. This is a significant improvement over existing literature, which at best explained less than 30 percent.},

The first is to determine, for the 30 largest U.S. metropolitan areas in 1980. the relationship among population size, the number of major corporations headquartered in these centers, and the number of subsidiaries located there. The expectation is that there will be positive relationships in all cases. Second, this study, based on variations in the relationships examined above, sets forth a corporate classification of the 30 metropolitan areas and identifies common characteristics and locations among six categories of centers. Finally, using the six-fold classification of centers, metropolitan employment growth between 1980 and 1986 is analyzed, especially job growth in services and in finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE). The six-fold classification proves useful in understanding employment growth in these 30 centers during the 1980s and, with modifications, perhaps beyond.},

The results support the hypothesis that corporations reach up the metropolitan hierarchy for banking services, i.e., they are more strongly linked with higher-order centers than with lowerorder metropolitan areas. A second hypothesis, also confirmed, is that larger corporations are more strongly tied to the upper end of the metropolitan hierarchy than are smaller firms. Although some elements of banking are located in the same metropolitan area as the corporate headquarters that use their services, a significant component of banking services—especially investment and foreign banking—involves intermetropolitan linkages. These linkages are national rather than regional and do not follow the traditional distance-decay model.},

  abstract  = {Abstract This study uses Federal Express Corporation data to examine information flows among 48 large metropolitan areas in the United States. Set within the context of emerging quaternary location theory, three hypotheses are introduced to explain the bases for information flows among metropolitan areas: information genesis, hierarchy of control, and spatial independence. Essential support is found for all three hypotheses. Supply considerations, rather than demand, are fundamental in information genesis; flows are strongly asymmetrical, reflecting a marked hierarchy of control; and distance plays a minor role in the spatial configuration of flows, especially at the highest level of the metropolitan hierarchy. New York, in particular, dominates the national structure of information flows, and only ten metropolitan areas act as command and control centers, creating a highly asymmetric flow in which these ten centers originate a high proportion of total flows. Principal components analysis identified five dominant centers of information genesis: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas-Ft. Worth. This research extends our understanding of quaternary location in that the largest metropolitan areas, containing the most specialized and scarce information, are most strongly interlocked with one another. In addition, the spatial extent of information flows and control by a metropolitan area decreases somewhat as the level of control of the center decreases. As the U.S. metropolitan economy continues to become more service and, therefore, more information-oriented, the future economic vitality of metropolitan areas is expected to depend on their position within the hierarchy of information control.},

  abstract = {This paper emerged from discussions held over a two-day symposium hosted by the University of Western Sydney and the Institute of Australian Geographers in December 2011. Drawing on contemporary themes in economic geography around postcolonial theory and a concern with the histories of the sub-discipline, the symposium sought to triangulate these discourses using Raewyn Connell’s (2006, 2007a, 2007b) concept of ‘Southern Theory’ as a means of beginning a process of critical reflection about the types of economic geographies that are produced from and in the ‘Antipodes’. After introducing these debates and presenting a critical reflection on how Connell’s Southern Theory potentially provides a useful means of bringing them into conversation, the paper presents five considerations from geographers who have made significant contributions to contemporary economic geography understandings, drawing on, in various ways, their Antipodean positionality. The paper assesses to what extent are Antipodean economic geography knowledges: (i) unique and embedded in specific conditions and events, (ii) inexorably tied to other economic geographical knowledges produced elsewhere and (iii) how Antipodean economic geography knowledges have been exported and assembled within and beyond the discipline of geography.},

  abstract={High-dimensional data in Euclidean space pose special challenges to data mining algorithms. These challenges are often indiscriminately subsumed under the term ‘curse of dimensionality’, more concrete aspects being the so-called ‘distance concentration effect’, the presence of irrelevant attributes concealing relevant information, or simply efficiency issues. In about just the last few years, the task of unsupervised outlier detection has found new specialized solutions for tackling high-dimensional data in Euclidean space. These approaches fall under mainly two categories, namely considering or not considering subspaces (subsets of attributes) for the definition of outliers. The former are specifically addressing the presence of irrelevant attributes, the latter do consider the presence of irrelevant attributes implicitly at best but are more concerned with general issues of efficiency and effectiveness. Nevertheless, both types of specialized outlier detection algorithms tackle challenges specific to high-dimensional data. In this survey article, we discuss some important aspects of the ‘curse of dimensionality’ in detail and survey specialized algorithms for outlier detection from both categories. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract  = {Diversification of real estate portfolios has historically been accomplished by utilizing a geographic and/or property-type strategy. More recently, a number of economically based diversification categories have been proposed by industry researchers (see Hartzell, Shulman and Wurtzebach, 1987 and Wurtzebach, 1988). This study tests the efficiency of the existing geographic and geographic/economic strategies currently in the literature against an economically based diversification strategy using straightforward government SIC code categories. The three strategies used include: the NCREIF four geographic regions; the Solomon Brothers eight regions (a combination of economics and geography); and a purely economic grouping of the 316 MSAs in the United States using the nine major government SIC code categories. This study finds that the addition of economic underpinnings to a geographically constrained model, as developed by Hartzell et al. (1987) creates a higher risk/return efficient frontier than the purely geographic NCREIF diversification model. However, shedding geography altogether and diversifying along purely economic lines provides an even better efficient frontier during real estate cycle recovery and growth periods. This new strategy provides the real estate portfolio manager with the opportunity to increase risk-adjusted returns with a strategy that is easily understood and applied.},

Specifically, using a sample of publicly traded real estate companies across the Asia-Pacific region, we examine how intrafirm geographic and cultural distance impacts a firm's capital acquisition costs. As a consequence of both the heavily regulated operating environment faced by these firms, as well as the capital intensive nature of this industry, funding costs should be of pronounced importance to firms within this sector. Consistent with this paradigm, we find that firms with geographically disperse investments exhibit enhanced informational opacity. Specifically, firms with more geographically disperse investments exhibit higher capital acquisition costs than their more geographically concentrated counterparts. Similarly, firms with more culturally disparate investments also exhibit enhanced informational opacity, as evidenced by increased capital costs. Additionally, we present evidence that the impact of both physical and cultural distance is increasing following the global financial crisis. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that both intrafirm geographic and cultural dispersion materially impact both an organization's information environment and funding costs.},

Unlike Coval and Moskowitz's (1999) findings on institutional investors, however, we find that advantageous information cannot explain individual investors' local bias. Accounting numbers and information asymmetry matter less to individual investors' local bias than to that of institutional investors. Instead, we hypothesize that individuals' non-fundamentally based familiarity with local companies and ready reaction to local information are more plausible explanations. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that individual investors are more likely to invest in remote companies that spend heavily on advertising. Evidence from investors' reactions to earnings announcements also confirms the hypothesis: local investors do not change their portfolios so as to take advantage of potentially advantageous information before earnings announcements. After earnings announcements, local investors change their portfolios more than remote investors in the direction opposite to the same earnings surprises.},

The geographic bias of the RBOC investors is closely related to the general tendency of households' portfolios to be concentrated, of employees' tendency to own their employers' stocks in their retirement accounts, and to the home country bias in the international arena. Together, these phenomena provide compeling evidence that people invest in the familiar while often ignoring the principles of portfolio theory.},

  abstract = {If finance is the engine driving economic and geographic change, then pensions are its primary vehicle. On the one hand, pension plan assets, which approached {\$}18 trillion dollars in 2005 for OECD countries, are having global impacts on financial markets. On the other hand, pension plan liabilities, larger than the assets in nominal terms, are also having dramatic impacts on plan sponsors. If assets are not properly managed, pension liabilities can threaten the financial solvency of plan sponsors. Consequently, as institutions with enormous and growing financial and political importance, this paper contends that the procedures governing pension plans are of increasing importance for economic geographers. In this paper, the effectiveness of the current governance system is tested through a widely subscribed 'expert survey'. Then, the relationship between pension fund governance and economic geography is demonstrated through case study. The paper concludes that the current governance model remains inadequate. Moreover, poor pension fund governance, in addition to having an economic cost, is shown to have tangible geographic impacts.},

Political bias is positively related to the percentage of politically-affiliated trustees on the board and Congressional connections. The more politically-affiliated trustees on the board, the more the fund shifts toward risky asset allocations.

  abstract = {As firms increasingly rely upon intangible assets such as human capital, innovative capacity, and brand equity, they are less able to tap traditional sources of capital such as bank or debt financing. Equity finance (the offering of ownership shares through public stock markets) is frequently the only means of finance available to knowledge-based firms or firms with few fixed assets. The intent of this research is to chart the spatial patterns of equity investment growth in the U.S. metropolitan system using the market capitalizations of 7,926 U.S. firms. Given the necessity of capital for economic growth, these patterns are of obvious importance to geographers. It is shown that volumes of equity investment are both highly skewed towards large firms, the service and FIRE sectors, and a core of metropolitan headquarters sites. Equity capital was found to flow away from Manufacturing Belt cities and towards cities dominated by smaller firms. In addition, it was found that changes in the volume of equity investment in locally headquartered firms is positively correlated to changes in personal income, population, and total employment.},

These models can capture word correlations in a collection of textual documents with a low-dimensional set of multinomial distribution, called “topics”.

In this paper, we study the inherent connection between the best topic structure and the distances among topics in Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and propose a method of adaptively selecting the best LDA model based on density. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve performance matching the best of LDA without manually tuning the number of topics.},

In this work we propose a measure to identify the correct number of topics and offer empirical evidence in its favor in terms of classification accuracy and the number of topics that are naturally present in the corpus. We show the merit of the measure by applying it on real-world as well as synthetic data sets(both text and images). In proposing this measure, we view LDA as a matrix factorization mechanism, wherein a given corpus C is split into two matrix factors M1 and M2 as given by Cd*w= M1d*tx Qt*w. Where d is the number of documents present in the corpus and w is the size of the vocabulary. The quality of the split depends on ``t'', the right number of topics chosen. The measure is computed in terms of symmetric KL-Divergence of salient distributions that are derived from these matrix factors. We observe that the divergence values are higher for non-optimal number of topics -- this is shown by a 'dip' at the right value for 't'.},

Specifically, the objectives are to relate the level of banking deposits among major metropolitan areas with (1) corporate importance, (2) population size, and (3) local government revenues. The Stanback hypothesis and the urban systems development concept provide the research framework. The concentration of major commercial banks in a relatively small number of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States is a salient feature of the geography of banking. As hypothesized, commercial banks are spatially associated with metropolitan population size, the clustering of major corporations, and sizable government revenues. These associations are especially strong among the very largest metropoliton areas, though they hold among centers of 200,000 and larger as well.},

In an investigation of the parameter estimates from a multiple linear regression model and a multiple logit regression model, conclusions are drawn about the sensitivity of such estimates to variations in scale and zoning systems. The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units. Given that such analyses can only be expected to increase with the imminent availability of new census data both in the United Kingdom and in the USA, and the current proliferation of GIS (geographical information system) technology which permits even more access to aggregated data, this paper serves as a topical warning.},

I find the average author experiences productivity gains of 11.94\% per annum when residing in London, the only major literary cluster – a gain not associated with living in any of the minor literary clusters. I find evidence of negative selection with respect to productivity, indicating the results are not driven by the self-selection of highly productive authors to London. I find heterogeneity of returns to living in London by birth cohort and Impact Index quartile (a measure of author quality) and that the cohorts who receive the greatest gains from locating in London are those for which there is the strongest evidence of negative selection with respect to productivity.},

  abstract = {Abstract We propose a novel multivariate method to analyse biodiversity data based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. LDA, a probabilistic model, reduces assemblages to sets of distinct component communities. It produces easily interpretable results, can represent abrupt and gradual changes in composition, accommodates missing data and allows for coherent estimates of uncertainty. We illustrate our method using tree data for the eastern United States and from a tropical successional chronosequence. The model is able to detect pervasive declines in the oak community in Minnesota and Indiana, potentially due to fire suppression, increased growing season precipitation and herbivory. The chronosequence analysis is able to delineate clear successional trends in species composition, while also revealing that site-specific factors significantly impact these successional trajectories. The proposed method provides a means to decompose and track the dynamics of species assemblages along temporal and spatial gradients, including effects of global change and forest disturbances.},
