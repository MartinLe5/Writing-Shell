Something goes here


As Ed Lyell, former member of Colorado State Board of Education and Telecommunication Advisory Commission, said in the Pew Report on the future of the internet said: 
	
\begin{quote}Peter Drucker wrote about the major transformations in history. The printing press, steam engine driven industrial revolution, and the then-emerging Internet. His main point, that I share, is that it takes a generation, about 25 years, for the new 'thing' to really have its impact. At first society uses the new tool to better do what they have been doing. 
		
The generation raised with it finds totally new things and ways to do things. Thus we will be working in jobs that we cannot now see or define. Going through our work and play days doing things we cannot now envision or perhaps which only a few now envision, but have trouble getting others to see their vision.   \citep{Pew2010}

	This chapter will use the more detailed xml-based 13-F HR reports covering the period of the second quarter 2013\footnote{April to June 2013  In practice, the 13-F Holdings Report relays the stocks at the closing of the second quarter, so in practice stocks held on June 28th at close of business.}
